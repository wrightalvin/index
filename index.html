During the nine years, as Gitlaxtaamiks Village Governments Recreation Director I’ve gained the knowledge and experience to plan, develop and implement an effective PM program and Program & Services for First Nations Recreation Facilities.A PM Program is an essential component to have in place before planning, developing and implementing Programs & Services for your facility. An effective PM Program, will show positive results each year to your “Bottom Line”.</p>

  <h1>Proposal Discription</h1>

  <h2>Setting Goals & Objectives</h2>

  <p>Before setting up the PM program for the facility, management and staff must first formulate the goals and objectives, which will guide the maintenance effort.

The overall GOAL for the PM program can be defined as attempting to keep every piece of operating equipment in perfect running order and anticipating potential problems in building conditions that effect down – time and cost.

Objectives for the PM program would include statements such as:

•	To maximize operating time and use of facility at reasonable cost;
•	To collect cost and related information needed to improve equipment performance;
•	To establish methods of evaluating work performance
•	To aid in establishing safe working conditions; and
•	To improve skills through training.

It is recommended that the goals and objectives be made specific to the type of facility in question. Once the goals and objectives are determined and a firm commitment is made to the PM program by all involved, the process of getting the program underway can begin.</p>
